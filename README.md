Application where you set how often you want to be notified to take a break.

From the beginning of writing code on my PC, I struggled with how much time 
I should spend time in one piece on improving my programming skills. 
I thought about what I will do for my productivity because I was spending much time in one piece of time without breaks.
Once, I had the idea of creating an application that would determine how long it would take for the program to notify me that I should take a break, and that application is here.
